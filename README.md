# ANALYSIS-OF-DIFFERENT-ALGORITHMS-FOR-PLANT-DISEASE-DETECTION
Evaluation of machine learning algorithms for plant disease detection.

This project focuses on the development and evaluation of machine learning algorithms for plant disease detection, aiming to identify the most effective approach among Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), ResNet50, and Predictive Information Neural Networks (PINN).
Parameter that are used like accuracy ,confusion matrix, precision, F1-score, recall.
Here , we have detected plant disease like Rust ,Powdery and also used healthy plant pictures. All data set trained with machine learning algorithms and checked which algorithm is giving more accurate results comparatively.
